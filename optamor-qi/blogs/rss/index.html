&lt;h2&gt;It’s my job to be interested in operational excellence - but what is it, exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Operational excellence: it sounds like a self-explanatory notion and something to which everyone should aspire. But there is more to the phrase than meets the eye. More methodology and more measurement, for starters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, operational excellence is a business philosophy that takes elements of continuous improvement sciences and applies them, combined with measurable performance metrics, right across your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an outsource partner in the recruitment and HR Managed Service Provision industry, I am interested in how we can encourage clients to apply operational excellence metrics to the service we provide, and be challenged to use continuous improvement methodology and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Managed Service partner worth its salt should be only too happy to be held to account by pre-agreed metrics; the value of these metrics, and the need for them, increases as the complexity of the service delivered increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their quest for operational excellence, I believe it is very important for my clients to look at how their recruitment procedures relate to one another, because procedures in isolation don’t benefit businesses as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the best out of business partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could put myself in a client’s shoes and give them some advice on how to get the best out of partners like me, I would start with this: When you engage with a partner firm, they should be keen to learn so much about your business that they can provide a full analysis and scoping piece on your wants and needs, and evaluate what you can expect to implement together as partners, very early in the scoping process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should include feasibility in terms of what can be achieved in-house and what might need to be outsourced: a long wish list might not be practicable using only in-house resources. An outsource partner must demonstrate a full and detailed understanding of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your partner firm should be keen to help you engage with your key stakeholders in order to drive change and ensure that appropriate measurements can be achieved. With measurements, look for outputs for continuous improvement. MSP is a baseline but quarterly stakeholder and business operation reviews identify the rhythm of the business. This paves the way to identifying additional projects to drive excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then be alert to the opportunities to challenge your partner. Are we helping you to listen to your stakeholder community to support change – for instance, mergers, acquisitions and new contract wins placing demands on staffing levels? Are we being innovative with our technology and coming up with new ways to deliver a solution to your organisational challenges? You may demand technology-agnostic approaches to solutions delivery, linking best of breed products to ATS or VMS platforms to enable onboarding programmes, analysis and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suppliers may come to you with pre-formed ideas about how they will deliver their solution. Does their solution fit the challenge, or are they reimagining the challenge to justify their preconceived solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on where the original scope of some of your agreements has evolved over time without the need for contract renegotiation, or what truly flexible MSP delivery looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Meet the Speaker: Miles Henson</title><description>We are delighted to announce that industry leading talent development specialist, Miles Henson, will be joining us at the HR Directors Business Summit on 4-5 February 2014 at the ICC, Birmingham.</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/meet-the-speaker-miles-henson/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1854.aspx</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1507/miles-henson-230x230.jpg" width="230" height="230" alt="Miles-Henson - 230x230.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet the Speaker: Miles Henson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;We are delighted to announce that industry leading talent development specialist, Miles Henson, will be joining us at the HR Directors Business Summit on 4-5 February 2014 at the ICC, Birmingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles is a global behavioural change and communication expert. His main focus is helping international organisations to engage more effectively with their people and to deliver high performing individuals and teams; ultimately supporting and delivering the success of the organisational strategy. As a people expert, Miles truly understands the link between business transformation, strategic development and the crucial role people play in that business success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of his time is spent working with Executive leadership teams, helping them work more efficiently together whilst delivering measurable results. More importantly, he helps them to create clarity on the golden threads that will help their people understand, own and deliver the corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely sought after as a keynote speaker at conferences - often about motivation, talent engagement and corporate communication - Miles also works at Executive level as a coach and mentor. He has managed and led at board level in several successful businesses, including Taylor Made, which won 8th Best Place to Work (Sunday Times, 2008) and Gold Standard Investors in People under his leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles is a master practitioner of a number of psychometric tools and is a fellow at Southampton Solent University, where he lectures third year students on Communication in the Workplace. He also hosts and presents 93.7 Express FM’s Business show each week, which is now in its fourth year and attracts over 40,000 listeners each week.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to attend the HR Directors Summit, don’t miss out on our fun and engaging Masterclass session &lt;em&gt;“Engaging your Talent: The Power of Storytelling”&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday 4th February at 16:10 (Stage 6)&lt;/strong&gt;.  The session, led by Miles, will focus on how leaders can harness the power of storytelling to communicate goals, convey their organisation’s strategy and values, or inspire and engage their people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary and Highlights of #HREvent14  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor has returned from two great days at the ICC in Birmingham having sponsored this year’s HR Directors Business Summit.  Drawing in senior HR professionals from large and small companies from across the world, the Summit was lively and fast-paced with a range of key note speakers, masterclasses, case studies and networking sessions.  We had an amazing time and thoroughly enjoyed meeting such a diverse group of interesting delegates and left feeling inspired by the words from industry experts and thought leaders from the world of work. &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard a provocative and stimulating session by world-renowned expert on labour market trends, David Arkless, the Future of Work Consortium.  David spoke of some of the major challenges being faced within human capital management across the globe including extreme longevity, the ageing population and how people are now working for as long as they possibly can because they can no longer afford to retire.  The knock on effect of this means that young people cannot get into the workforce and David estimated that roughly 100 million young people are now long term unemployed across the world right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Europe as an example of what’s happening demographically on a global scale, David said that within the next 17 years Europe will lose 50 million workers due to the falling rates in fertility and through death or retirement and pressed the need for Europe to start opening its borders to skilled labour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also spoke of the rise of smart machines saying that “Over the next 20 years robots, processors, machines and automated services will take your place and will do what you do, twice as well as you and twice as fast.”  Arkless said “This will cause us as human beings to ask ourselves the question: If the world is full of robots, processors and technology - what are we good at?  What should we focus on? How should we interact with the new machine world?”  A huge question for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David told delegates that “Along with the machine world, we are moving into a new computational world of big data and computer storage that is making a new horizon of things possible.”  Citing a recent IBM report, he said that “Every second on this planet there are 10 trillion devices connected together and 20 trillion records of every individual somewhere on this planet.”  The world is becoming much more sophisticated in the way we use data and how we interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding his session David gave some statistics based on a view of the world if it were reduced to just 100 people.  “52 would be women and 48 would be men; 89 hetrosexual and 11 homosexual; 30 Caucasians and 70 non-Caucasians; 6 people would own 60% of the world’s wealth; 80 live in poverty; 1 is dying; 1 is being born...80 have a cell phone.”  A stark reminder of how diverse the world we live in is and how it is changing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Graeme Codrington presented a truly thought-provoking session about the tides of change that are shaping the HR landscape.   He spoke of the turbulent time of change we are all living in where we continually tell ourselves to “hang in there”, and that “things will get back to normal soon”.  It will never be the same again says Graeme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codrington cited the five key forces at play in HR as the ‘TIDES’ of change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Technology&lt;br /&gt;2. Institutional Change&lt;br /&gt;3. Demographics&lt;br /&gt;4. Environment &amp;amp; Ethics&lt;br /&gt;5. Shifting Social Values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graeme spoke of how the world is undergoing deep structural change and urged delegates to become more proactive in recognising the forces disrupting the world of work.  “Understand the forces disrupting your industry so you can pre-empt the people requests of your senior leaders,” he said.  He also suggested that HR directors and managers should devote at least five minutes of their team meetings to discuss changes and possible disruptive forces. He said: “Ask: What’s changing? What are the new rules? And how do we respond?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the breakout innovation of Google’s driverless car (now legal in Nevada, California and soon to be in Milton Keynes in the UK), Graeme used this as an example of sizeable change and explored what the knock on effect would be on all other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graeme predicted that by 2025 these cars will not only be legal, they will be compulsory.  “If every car in a particular environment is driverless, every single car is able to not only drive itself through the streets, but also has the potential to connect and communicate with every single other car and between them, they can negotiate a temporary traffic pattern just for them.”  A network of computers is able to do things that we as human beings are not able to do.  The promise that massively increased computing power that’s made mobile, cheap and accessible – this is what can come to your office.  Codrington said “Using yesterday’s logic is the greatest danger to businesses,” and asked delegates to consider “What is your driverless car?  What is the concept in your business that computers can do that human beings cannot?  What is the next stage in evolution of the digital age in your company, in your industry, in your office?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optamor’s masterclass session “Engaging your Talent: The Power of Storytelling” took place on Tuesday afternoon and Paul Martin and Miles Henson were absolutely delighted to present to a jam-packed conference room of delegates.  Miles began the session with an exercise that had everyone on their feet spinning (carefully) around with their eyes closed.  The result of which left all 88 delegates pointing their hands in completely different directions illustrating the point that if your employees are not engaged and cannot see where they fit into the strategy of your organisation, how can they expected to head in the same direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of the masterclass Miles and Paul explored how using storytelling can help engage the talent in your organisation, creating the ‘golden thread’ that makes them feel a part of something and connects and aligns the actions of everyone in the business.  Moreover, using pictures to depict future corporate direction ensures consistent messages that cannot be easily skewed by the cynics in your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would like to thank all the delegates who attended our masterclass session and to those who visited our stand in the exhibition hall.  A big thanks to our staff who helped support the event, to Miles Henson for co-hosting our masterclass and to all the WTG staff who looked after us impeccably throughout our time at the ICC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Highlights: HR &amp; Training Insights Forum - 27 Feb 2014</title><description>Optamor hosted a successful HR &amp;amp; Training Insights Forum at Langstone Technology Park on Thursday 27th February.

&lt;h2&gt;Highlights: HR &amp;amp; Training Insights Forum - 27 Feb 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor hosted a successful HR &amp;amp; Training Insights Forum at Langstone Technology Park on Thursday 27th February. The forum was very well received by delegates who attended from the local HR community and we had some great feedback from the event. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Security and HR &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum, which was completely free for all delegates to attend, consisted of two separate topic sessions, the first of which was hosted by leading security expert, Craig Goodwin (VP Information Security at Monster Worldwide).  As a respected authority on holistic security, and in particular the human factor in information security, Craig discussed the current state of information security and how it pertains to HR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, information security has had one constant: change.  Craig spoke of the difficulty in keeping up with the pace of this change.  With the focus having moved away from purely physical access and where data is located, the digital revolution has now created a world that is always on and always connected which presents new challenges in relation to information security.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig went on to say that whilst the way in which we communicate information has now changed, the fundamental principles of security have not.  He said “people have data on their iPads, iPhones and are uploading to Facebook and LinkedIn, but realistically as long as you’ve got some kind of control over that data and you understand the control then that is what is important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Articulating how Monster is endeavouring to deal with the security of its data, Paul used the analogy of it being less like a house in terms of using locks, fences, gates and guard dogs (technically being firewalls, safes, routers, switches etc) to keep everyone out and away from data. Whilst this is great, it is also very archaic and having a perimeter control is no longer needed as the data in that environment is not there anymore – it is being walked out of the gate on everyone’s iPad/iPhone! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Craig said that in today’s world it is more pertinent to become more like a hotel.  Rather than not letting anyone in - that is exactly what you do. You have a big reception area where everyone can come in (your website) then you have a number of rooms coming off the reception that can be protected separately.  If someone needs HR, then the wall of that room will be thicker, it will have a stronger bolt on it, an alarm and a safe.  But that level of security is only needed for certain rooms (important parts of the business such as HR, finance, proprietary data, code etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The areas that it wants people to come in and choose and use will be much more open, such as allowing people to use tools and apps on their iPad and bring in their own device to use on the network – as long as they don’t touch any of that sensitive data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig explored some of the current hot topics within the security field, such as the Snowden incident and the recent spate of cyber attacks, and demonstrated along the way how HR and information security departments should work more closely together to minimise such risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the forum was led by Paul Miller, International Performance Coach.  Paul explored the fascinating subject of Emotional Intelligence and shared information on the effect it plays on us and how we can use it to improve our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul started the session with a fun exercise that illustrated how we all make assumptions about things which makes life more difficult for ourselves, when in fact we can achieve better results when performing the same task just by looking at it with a different mindset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul engaged the audience in another group exercise that showed delegates the difference between Intellectual Intelligence (IQ) and Emotional Intelligence (EQ).  He said that we spend the majority of our time only improving our IQ skills and merely accept the fact that our EQ skills are based on the way we are and are not developed any further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To be the best we possibly can, we need to constantly change.”  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul said “Emotional Intelligence is defined as the capacity to recognise and utilise emotional states to change intentions and behaviour.” He also said it means “having the ability to recognise different emotional states; assessing the effects of emotions on subsequent behaviour; and having the ability to switch into the best emotional state to manage a particular situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asking who in the audience had experienced a fairly challenging time in the world of work over the last three years, the majority of delegates indicated that they had.  “When times are challenging, we find out more about ourselves - we find out about our limits, capabilities and what we are prepared to do,” said Paul. “When life is easy, we live in this comfort zone, but for us to perform at our best in any situation it’s about how we mange our emotions effectively to utilise the skills that we have.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why should you know about EI?  Paul told delegates that 70% of the reasons for losing clients are EI-related.  He said that “poor service, poorly handled complaints, unpleasant interactions, no follow-up, not going the extra mile and a lack of human connection have all contributed to this."  He also said that 75% of the reasons why careers get derailed are EI-related.  Unsatisfactory team leadership during challenging times, inability to handle interpersonal issues and an inability to adapt to change and elicit trust are all typical reasons for this.  “You’ll know a good leader in time of change/challenge,” said Paul. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paul also spoke of the Chimp Model (Dr Steve Peters’ book, The Chimp Paradox: the Mind Management Programme to Help You Achieve Success, Confidence and Happiness) in which he simplistically refers to humans as having three brains.  The frontal lobe (human), the parietal lobe (computer) and the limbic lobe (‘the Chimp’) that combine to form the ‘Psychological Mind’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;Although these three brains try to work together, they very frequently get in conflict and struggle against each other to gain control – with the Chimp often winning! Paul said “our challenge as humans is to be able to get the brains to work together, and that is where we start developing our Emotional Intelligence.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul stated that “our IQ is fully developed by the age of 19-20 years old and starts to recede in our late 40-50’s”.  However, he said that “our Emotional Intelligence is something we can grow throughout our lives – it is a muscle that can be grown like any other, through development and work.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prefrontal cortex, crucial to our rational decision making, can only hold up to seven pieces of information at any one time. Paul spoke of some of the strong negative emotions that we can sometimes suffer from - particularly those within the HR profession who can often take on the stress of employee problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;He referred to an ‘Amygdala Hijack’, a term (coined by Daniel Goleman in his book Emotional Intelligence: Why it Can Matter More Than IQ) that describes emotional responses from people which are immediate and overwhelming.  It produces a fight or flight response which results in errors in work and in memory, an inability to react flexibly and the chemical Cortisol being released into the body (which takes approximately three hours to clear). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paul concluded the session by explaining the benefits of developing Emotional Intelligence.  “What’s in your tool box to help you deal with life’s situations?” he asked. Finishing with an amusing clip from Ally McBeal, Paul asked the audience to think “What is your theme song?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wear a Hat Day - Raising Money for Brain Tumour Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;On Friday 28th March Optamor proudly took part in this year’s Wear a Hat Day - the UK’s largest and most famous national brain tumour awareness and fundraising campaign, created by Brain Tumour Research.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This campaign supports a deadly serious issue: Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under 40. The research is woefully underfunded, with less than 1% of the national government spending on cancer research being channelled towards brain tumours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our office was filled with a multitude of hats from baseball caps, cowboy hats, a fireman hat, a jester hat and even police riot headgear!  We had lots of fun and along with the other companies in the Serocor Group (ARM, Serocor Solutions and BLOC) we helped to raise over £240 for this great cause.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared our photos throughout the day on our social channels using the hashtag #wearahatday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Optamor Ladies Raise £535 for Cancer Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The ‘Optamor Ladies’ (Katie Cope, Jessica Martin, Allie Moon, Tara and Bethany Davies and Sarah and Bryony Rawcliffe) took part in this year’s 5K Race for Life in Southsea on Sunday 20th July.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team met up on Southsea common under the blazing sunshine along with the other entrants – women and girls of all ages, shapes and sizes; decked out in decorative pink outfits and fancy dress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 7,000 people took part in the whole event, pounding the streets of Southsea and filling the area with a sea of pink.  The route took the team on a lap across both grass and tarmac, taking in Ladies' Mile and the fantastic sea views along the promenade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartfelt messages were displayed on the backs of fellow ladies’ bibs, many running in memory of a loved one who has battled with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowds of supporters filled the roadsides clapping and cheering, giving everyone a much needed extra boost of energy under the searing heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to everyone who took part and a big thanks for all the kind donations received to support this amazing charity - with your help we raised £535.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor, ARM and Hawker Chase are proud sponsors of the RAF Benevolent Fund’s Battle of Britain Golf Classic on Thursday 11th September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rafbf.org/"&gt;RAF Benevolent Fund&lt;/a&gt; Battle of Britain Golf Classic attracts players from a wide range of business sectors as well as the Royal Air Force and private supporters, and raises funds to support their important welfare work. This year, the event is honoured to host Battle of Britain veterans as guests of honour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s event takes place at &lt;a href="http://www.oldthorns.com/golf-course-in-hampshire/"&gt;Old Thorns Golf &amp;amp; Country Estate&lt;/a&gt;, near Liphook in Hampshire. The par-72 Peter Alliss designed course is meticulously maintained and its mature trees, natural springs, lakes and testing bunkers give real character to the course. To add extra excitement, we also run hotly contested competitions for the longest drive, hole-in-one and nearest pin. Teams playing at the event will enjoy an excellent day of golf followed by a drinks reception and black tie dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optamor is proud to sponsor this fantastic event to help raise funds for the RAF Benevolent Fund and we hope it will be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Trailblazers apprenticeships: building new schemes for the recruitment industry</title><description>Optamor is part of the Serocor Group, which has been chosen to lead a group of ten UK recruitment companies during the third phase of the government’s successful Trailblazers apprenticeship scheme.</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/trailblazers-apprenticeships-building-new-schemes-for-the-recruitment-industry/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1903.aspx</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1497/apprenticeships-230x230.jpg" width="230" height="230" alt="Apprenticeships 230X230.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trailblazers apprenticeships: building new schemes for the recruitment industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor is part of the Serocor Group, which has been chosen to lead a group of ten UK recruitment companies during the third phase of the government’s successful Trailblazers apprenticeship scheme.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trailblazers is an employer-led programme that aims to lead the way in developing new world class apprenticeships. We’ll be working with other recruitment companies and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to design, develop and implement apprenticeship schemes for the recruitment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Goff, Learning &amp;amp; Development Manager at Serocor, has been appointed chair of the recruiters’ Trailblazers group. Commenting on his appointment and the Trailblazers programme, Derek said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Trailblazers programme offers UK businesses a fantastic opportunity to shape the next generation of apprenticeship schemes – giving them increased value for both employers and apprentices. Our industry is thriving and we want to make recruitment a career of choice for school leavers by offering apprenticeships that lead to a clear career path driven by assessment and a nationally-recognised qualification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister &lt;span&gt;Nick Boles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 20.02px;"&gt;said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“I congratulate Serocor for the key role it is playing in developing new top-quality apprenticeships. Through the trailblazers initiative companies like Serocor, in collaboration with their industry partners, will give people the skills they need to thrive and our businesses need to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title="Nick Boles"&gt;Nick Boles&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very excited that our company is involved in the government's Trailblazers scheme and particularly proud that Derek Goff has been chosen to chair the recruiters' group within it. Reforms using this employer-led approach should see apprenticeship schemes evolving to better suit the requirements of today’s recruitment industry and school leavers wishing to work in recruitment – making apprenticeships better fit for purpose for everyone involved and leading to fruitful careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor is delighted to announce winning the 'Best People Development Business' award as part of the Serocor Group at the 2014 IRP awards. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with great pleasure to announce that we were winners at this year’s IRP awards hosted by former Communard, now BBC radio presenter and author, Reverend Richard Coles at Westminster’s Park Plaza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather Cracknell, Head of People Development, and Derek Goff, Learning and Development Manager, from Serocor Solutions collected the award on behalf of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“We felt very honoured to be shortlisted for this award and are totally delighted to have been awarded the accolade. We originally won the People Development in business category in 2009, and this is a clear testament to the ongoing significance and investment the Serocor Group pays to the professional and social development of our staff. Without the enthusiasm for learning and development shared by our people, we would not be the company we are today.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment and Employment Confederation chief executive, Kevin Green, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Hearty congratulations to all of the 2014 winners. These are people and businesses who continually go the extra mile in their mission to help candidates and employers be as successful as possible. The quality of entries this year was exceptional and all those shortlisted truly are ambassadors for the high standards and inspirational work the IRP expects of recruiters across the country.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be nominated for these awards is an accolade in itself and we are very pleased to have won this award in recognition of the ongoing investment in the professional development of our employees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Serocor Group employees attain their Certificate in Recruitment Practice</title><description>Last December 15 members of the Serocor Group (comprising of ARM, Bloc, Optamor and Serocor Solutions) sat their CertRP exam and we are please to announce that everyone passed with flying colours.

&lt;h2&gt;Serocor Group employees attain their Certificate in Recruitment Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Last December 15 members of the Serocor Group (comprising of ARM, Bloc, Optamor and Serocor Solutions) sat their CertRP exam and we are pleased to announce that everyone passed with flying colours. The entry level 3 Certificate in Recruitment Practice QCF (CertRP) is ideal for new recruiters or those who are looking to further their careers. This qualification aims to increase personal effectiveness and build upon their knowledge, enhancing the service they provide to clients and candidates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course comprised of six units which they studied over three months before sitting the exam in the run up to Christmas. The qualification enables them to progress within the business and be considered for promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Goff, Serocor’s Learning and Development Manager, was pleased to announce the success of this latest cohort of learners. “After much anxiety and reflection on the previous few weeks' study, all have passed, and have been awarded their certificates. Congratulations to everyone and we look forward to seeing your ‘MIRP Cert RP’ status after your name!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of quotes from the staff that sat the exam: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am very pleased to have passed the exam and it really brought together all of the industry knowledge I have picked up throughout my career. The exam was tough; however our in house trainer Derek Goff broke down the modules for us and made the information easier to digest. The CertRP is a recruitment must-have and I would also like to say a massive well done to everyone in the Serocor Group who took the exam and passed,” Andrew Carr (Serocor Solutions recruiter).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our top student was James Houghton, closely followed by Claire Bennett, so a special congratulations goes out to them for setting the standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Completing the CertRP qualification has been an opportunity to learn more about the industry I work in, whilst gaining a recognised qualification. I have surprised myself with my results and I’m glad I revised,” James Houghton (ARM recruiter). &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Optamor Attends Inmarsat-5 F2 (I-5 F2) Satellite Launch</title><description>Optamor were pleased to join in the celebrations of the successful launch of the Inmarsat-5 F2 (I-5 F2) on 1 February.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Optamor were pleased to join in the celebrations of the successful launch of the Inmarsat-5 F2 (I-5 F2) on 1 February. Peta Earles, Bally Chima and Claire Proudlove attended the special launch day event which was attended by almost 400 members of staff and their families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brunch was provided for all attendees, held at Inmarsat’s headquarters in City Road, London. There was plenty of nervous excitement in the air as everyone kept a watchful eye on the countdown clocks that displayed the time to lift-off at 12:31 GMT.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brunch was followed by LEGO rocket building and a space-themed fancy dress parade (sadly only for the younger attendees!) in which the children got to show off their amazing outfits. Prizes were awarded for the best costumes and all the children received I-5 F2 branded goodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd assembled in the Constellation Room as the I-5 F2 satellite streamed live on the screen from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. The Inmarsat-5 F2 launch was the first ILS Proton launch in 2015 (and the third Inmarsat satellite launched on ILS Proton). The crowd joined in the countdown and erupted in applause and cheers as the Proton rocket powered into orbit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's National Apprenticeship Week!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;National Apprenticeship week is designed to celebrate apprenticeships and the positive impact they have on individuals, business and the wider economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the Serocor Group (encompassing ARM, Optamor, Bloc and Hawker Chase) have fully endorsed apprenticeship qualifications, supporting 15 employees through sales, business administration and marketing qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Goff, Learning and Development Manager for the Group, is qualified as an Assessor to further support our learners in the workplace: “I was personally involved in the forum to create the current Recruitment Apprenticeship and since its launch I have been involved in the development of the Level 2 Resourcer’s qualification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks we have engaged with Learndirect to enrol 5 learners onto the new Level 3 Recruitment Apprenticeship. We firmly believe that having an industry-relevant framework of vocational competency and knowledge-based assessment will both empower our staff to higher levels of success, whilst improving the service delivery to our customers and also professionalising the industry to standards not previously achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“I have only been working within the recruitment industry since starting the Apprenticeship in October and since then have been offered a great opportunity to progress my learning to develop my career. I have learnt so much during this time and know exactly what steps I need to make to complete this course and get the level of qualification I deserve. Completing this qualification will enable me to make a mark on the recruitment industry and progress within the company. The support they have provided me has been fantastic”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Industry Benchmarking: What is the Optimal "Recruiter Req Load" for Technology Businesses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Managing Director of Optamor Talent Partnerships, Paul 'the guru' Mallinson, ponders why resourcing is viewed as a cost centre - or is it? He suggests that the first thing is to deal with the root cause of this challenge on the internal resourcing function’s capacity. &lt;em&gt;Why is the question being asked?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In short, if the function is seen as a cost centre then the challenge is linked to the number of heads required to deliver the service and the ratio is used as a mechanism to control cost. Sadly this almost invariably ends in an underfunded resourcing function that struggles to deliver on expectations due to lack of resource.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title="Paul Mallinson"&gt;Paul Mallinson&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say: "An alternative model that would remove the need for the debate would be an internal trading mechanism based on a price list for services, that if set at the right level would be scalable for peaks and troughs in recruitment and focus the debate on the outputs of the function as opposed to whether there are enough heads to deliver the service. The right commercial model would move the function into an internal trading entity where success depended on use of the service at an agreed price - driving quality of service, engagement and output like any other commercial arrangement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the topic discussed by HR &amp;amp; Recruitment Leaders at the recent OasisHR Resourcing Think Tank, for which Optamor is a strategic partner, engaged on the basis of its unique integrated talent offering and to deliver thought leadership to its 1600 members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Serocor Group Win the 'South's Most Ambitious Company' Award&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The Serocor Group (encompassing ARM, Optamor, Bloc, Hawker Chase and Serocor Solutions) are delighted to be awarded Decision Magazine’s ‘South’s Most Ambitious Companies’ award. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award ceremony, held at Fetcham Park House, was attended by 25 companies who were not able to nominate themselves for entry into the awards.  Decision Magazine arranged for an independent judge to assess more than 5000 companies based in the South of England and mark them against a set of measures - financial credentials were not taken into account.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The criteria included a desire to build a business of some significance, to be a leader rather than a follower and an ability to think and act strategically,” explained Jon Da Costa, a partner at Baker Tilly. At the award presentation, Tim Sadka, partner at Rawlison Butler, said “an ambitious company has a determination to succeed regardless of any obstacles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was a humbling experience to be in a room of business leaders who are recognised for achieving growth and who are following a similar plan to us across different industry sectors. It is a great achievement for the Group and recognises the hard work of our employees and their commitment to our vision. On a personal note it is also nice to be recognised for my ambition to grow the business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Managing Director of Optamor Talent Partnerships, Paul Mallinson, takes a minute to ponder...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;With 93% of human communication conducted visually, the strength of video interviews is plain for all to see, or is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the debate, share your views and hear the thoughts of other organisations on this subject in Optamor QI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Our Optamor sponsored think tank raises some interesting views on the real value of using video interviewing. Read the Executive Summary &lt;a href="http://oasishr.com/rtt-the-real-impact-of-video-interviewing/" title="The Real Impact of Video Interviewing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The general census being that the consistency it provides, with all candidates being asked the same set of specifically tailored questions, and the recruiter having the opportunity to review, replay and rate candidates in a controlled and comparative way, is driving adoption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single with GSOH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your opinion, one thing is for certain, we live in a world that is built on our ability to influence people's views. One such area being online dating sites (or so I have been told by a good friend) where video interviews have been used for years in finding the perfect match, with varying degrees of success (or so he tells me)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal view is that you need a balanced approach to selection that considers skills, culture alignment, behaviours and experience, to name a few. Therefore, using a variety of methods that include video interviewing to capture and assess these is a great addition to your toolkit, and can make a real statement around the candidate experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My word of warning goes to candidates. If video is the future, candidates need to be prepared and consider the challenges of being captured on video, as there is a clear expectation that this is an appropriate test and pressure for the best talent, at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;&lt;strong style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;How do you compare? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;Do you have a successful recruitment, HR or marketing team who use sophisticated and successful methods to attract, engage and retain customers? Do you reflect these in your relationship with your employees? Have you ever stopped to think about whether those great relationships, processes and the energy that you put into them are mirrored in how you interact daily with your employees and teams? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where the war on talent is increasing, the employment market is evolving and people now move between organisations to develop their skills and experience... We need to ask ourselves whether there are elements of the customer model which could be translated to improve employee satisfaction and retention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are your people policies as agile, adaptable and innovative as those that drive your business? Creating consistency of your employee experience and unlocking the full potential of your team members is paramount. If you treated your employees more like your customers would you get additional productivity and buy-in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer relationships are built, nurtured and developed; do your team members feel as valued? Are they a business advocate or champion? Do they take every opportunity to tell their friends and networks what a great place it is to work? Can you harness that to drive attraction and interest in your business? If you don’t, you should. Your employees’ insights should be your insights and they should be used and communicated effectively for both employee and business growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business development and change management are familiar customer concepts, offering courses and practical training to your team that develop their skills and experience will benefit you both and positively impact satisfaction and employee retention.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optamor’s Talent &amp;amp; Training Partnership teams regularly see the positive output and return on investment both to employee satisfaction and succession planning. Link your recruitment and training goals; develop your business from within whilst attracting and harnessing the best external talent you need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climb the league table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;The Think Tank analogy of football leagues is an interesting concept. As an avid Reading FC fan and season ticket holder, I know that a successful squad is made up of many different sorts of player; reflect that in your internal team. Do you need the support of temporary loan signing (an interim resource)? Does your squad need extra training sessions (using your L&amp;amp;D budget for maximum benefit and return)? And how do they plan for that big game...well that is down to you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;As Cassie says: “Should managers be measured on things such as employee engagement of their teams? Giving employees a chance to develop and express their needs is essential in the same way marketers listen to customers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;Does your Employee Value Proposition really reflect who you are and who your employees aspire to be? Optamor’s diagnostic and audit team ask these questions on a regular basis and unlike a good customer relationship the results can be surprising, almost like an FA Cup giant killing game...How will you measure your success?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;Our Optamor sponsored Think Tank raises some interesting views on this subject. Read the Executive Summary &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="line-height: 1.43;" href="http://oasishr.com/ttt-creating-a-great-employee-experience-by-borrowing-from-the-customer-model/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Congratulations to the Finalists in the Global Recruiter Awards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead" style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;The Serocor Group (encompassing ARM, Optamor, Bloc, Hawker Chase and Serocor Solutions) are delighted to reach the finals in two categories of Global Recruiter UK Industry Awards, winners will be announced at an awards ceremony on the 25 June.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People Development team have been shortlisted in the Best In-house Training category for work in moving employees forward in their career and increasing their effectiveness. This success follows their recent win in the IRP 2014 Award for Best People Development Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment Consultant Adam Razzell has reached the finals of the Best Temporary Consultant category for his sales performance, customer service and taking a leading role in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Recruiter UK Industry Awards are judged by a team of experts drawn from the industry itself. These awards identify the best of the best from the current UK recruitment industry according to clear criteria. Each category sets out to record and reward the very best practice in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serocor Group - Best In-house Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People Development team support all five businesses within the Group. It has aligned its approach to the business goals of improved productivity, efficiency and ROI – delivering an outstanding service whilst extracting the best possible outcomes.  The team firmly believe that people development extends beyond the immediate work environment and that people have very different development needs; with an understanding that developing needs at a personal level positively impacts the working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely ecstatic that our efforts have been recognised once again on the awards platform,” comments Heather Cracknell, Head of People Development. “We look forward to continuing our success story as we play out our belief that people development doesn’t start and end with our own staff; it extends our brand beyond our immediate space, to engender a culture of developing our future staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People Development at the Serocor Group combines a range of mechanisms into a programme that meets development needs at the individual, team and business levels. This includes external training, management development, apprenticeships, certifications, qualifications and interactive learning modules through the ARM Learning Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Razzell - Best Temporary Consultant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam was new to recruitment when he joined ARM two and a half years ago, he exceeded his own expectations and went from zero to hero within months, joining top billers from across the business as ‘Rookie of the Year’ in a trip to New York. His success has continued and further accolades have followed, he now mentors other trainees passing on his ethics, winning characteristics and recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam, who works in ARM’s Infrastructure &amp;amp; Built Environment (IBE) division with a focus on placing engineers into careers within the rail sector, comments: “I am thrilled to be recognised in this way for the hard work I have put in over the last few years. I feel this achievement is a combination of my own approach and attitude, along with the incredibly supportive working environment and winning culture here at ARM”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team are looking forward to the awards ceremony which will be held on 25 June 2015 at Café de Paris, London from 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What Your Business Can Learn From Talent Management In Sport</title><description>With only a few games left in the football league season, thoughts of supporters begin turning to the summer transfer window, during which hundreds of millions of pounds will be spent, as players are…</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/what-your-business-can-learn-from-talent-management-in-sport/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1931.aspx</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1493/talent-management-and-sport-230x230.png" width="230" height="230" alt="Talent management and sport 230X230.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Your Business Can Learn From Talent Management In Sport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;With only a few games left in the football league season, thoughts of supporters begin turning to the summer transfer window, during which hundreds of millions of pounds will be spent, as players are traded, based on the talent they have and the demand for their specific skills. However, look past the eye watering sums of money and there is a lot that businesses can learn from how sports teams approach the management of talent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Real Madrid broke the transfer record and spent in the region of £80 million to secure the services of Gareth Bale in September 2013 they did so because they needed his skills and talent in a specific position. Yes, he is the most expensive footballer in the world, but he still must train hard every day to nurture that talent, and he is coached and managed to ensure his performance is benefiting the whole team in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is sport or business (regardless as to whether you are a service or product focused organisation, an SME or a large enterprise) if you don’t optimise your talent you will lose your competitive edge, or will never achieve your aspirations. Crucially, to succeed it isn’t about embarking on a one off project, but implementing an ongoing process that becomes part of the fabric of the business. Scouts, coaches and managers never stop thinking about the talent they have, what they need, how they can get it and how they can get the best from it, and neither should you. Gareth Bale’s talent was found and nurtured by Southampton Football Club, a team that has invested and as a result made millions of pounds from developing, benefiting from and selling talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your eye off the ball when it comes to talent (to keep with the theme!) and it may not impact your business immediately but you can be sure it will in time. Similarly, keep focused and you will reap the rich rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with this in mind here are the key questions that I would ask you to begin thinking about today… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What talent do we have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we using our talent in the right way?  Do we have the right players in the right positions? Gareth Bale was a defender during his time at Southampton but spotting his ability to play in the midfield transformed the fortunes of Tottenham, and also that of the player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is enough being done to engage and retain our top talent? If not you can be sure your competitors will be looking at ways to poach them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What talent will we need and where are the talent gaps? Do we need to look externally, can we train and develop internally and mobilise across the business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What talent will we need in the future and how should we plan for it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we connect, engage and build the best talent for our business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;If you want a loyal, dedicated and driven team then you need to create and maintain the right environment. Ensure individuals feel valued, confident and rewarded, but also challenge them to fully utilise their talents to the best of their ability. By giving them the opportunity to grow, improve and achieve and so too will your organisation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Director of Client Services at Optamor, Claire Proudlove, invites you to grab a quick cuppa while she ponders...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The impact of Redefining Recruiter KPIs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the debate, share your views and hear the thoughts of other organisations on this subject in Optamor QI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;KPIs, what do they mean to Talent professionals? Are they merely a measurement to see what activity has taken place each week? Does a best practice methodology exist where KPIs drive review, analysis and discussion? Do they address the challenges businesses face when attracting talent? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;The Oasis HR Think Tank explored the current business drivers for redefining recruitment KPIs and the general consensus was that KPIs are often inappropriately set. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;A KPI should not be a procurement driven process, it should address the business need. Historically businesses looked more at the cost of hiring talent than the quality of the employees and contractors who entered their organisation. Often KPIs are linked to external facing activity only, by looking at one side of the process your internal candidates may be experiencing a worse recruitment experience than those you are externally attracting. That does nothing for your internal brand or your staff retention. Your employees deserve the same level of consideration as those you are trying to attract.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPIs must evolve with your business. Are your KPI measures proactive? Are you just looking at the here and now, or do your KPIs reflect where you are as a company? Are you including review and measurement against building talent pools, candidate engagement and those activities that will give your organisation long term benefit? Are your KPIs adaptable for both the period of measurement and for your full organisation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the original KPIs agreed are not working then change them, ensure that they are working for your organisation. Measurement of a series of pointless KPIs will use up valuable time that can be spent more productively elsewhere. Measure yourselves as well as your business partners, are the KPIs targets or indicators? How do you analyse the results and get business benefit thereafter? Are you measuring experience alongside activity? With Employer Value Proposition being essential in the war for talent what are candidate experiences telling you? What do you need to do as a result? What is your end goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oasis HR Think Tank believes that “Many resourcing functions are currently using a set of KPIs that do not take into account the impact hiring managers have on the process”. This is common across many organisations and for that reason KPIs should be where appropriate reciprocal in nature and seek to measure how your business is actually performing. This review and analysis can then become the catalyst for change. Do the findings point to a potential process change which better meets the expectations of the business or has a training need been identified? Accountability and awareness of all individuals involved in the recruitment process and their impact on it will ultimately lead to a better recruitment solution overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you make KPIs work for you? Do not look at the data in isolation, think about what is actually happening and which individuals are positively or negatively impacting your KPIs. Think about KPI results as the data output from your recruitment activities. Review this information and consider what it is telling you. Do you have issues in attracting candidates to your business? Do you have a high offer decline rate? Do you have poor candidate experiences? What has created this, what can you do to change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are target driven KPIs leading to poor decisions as the KPI output is the goal? If KPIs were business drivers that lead to recruitment success, an enviable position in the candidate market and great recommendations from those your business has engaged with; surely that is their best use. Linking KPIs solely to financial performance could drive the wrong behaviours and lead to the wrong outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Oasis HR Think Tank said “Gathering data and conducting thorough analysis is essential to be predictive and ensure that the resourcing function is as efficient and successful as possible. With any business initiative it is essential to be able to demonstrate ROI for changes so it is essential to capture this data pre and post change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City Cycle 300...And they are off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Today 11 challengers and 4 support crew from The Serocor Group of companies set-off on a gruelling challenge to ride 300 miles over 3 days with a target to raise £20,000 in aid of the Naomi House &amp;amp; Jacksplace hospices for children and young adults. The event will take place over three days, completing a gruelling 100 miles and 7-8 hours in the saddle per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About #CC300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challengers include members of the senior management team at the Serocor Group (encompassing &lt;a href="http://www.arm.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://hellobloc.com/"&gt;Bloc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.optamor.com/"&gt;Optamor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hawkerchase.com/home.aspx"&gt;Hawker Chase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.serocor.com/"&gt;Serocor Solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) as well as riders and support crew from across the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Hickling, Senior Recruitment Consultant at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://arm.co.uk/"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is one of the riders and was central in organising the event, commented, &lt;em&gt;“It is a challenging course. The team will be burning around 7,000 calories per day and will climb over 700ft through the North Sussex and South Downs, climbing over 6,000ft in total. In the team we have an Iron Man Challenger, as well as a mixture of gym-goers and some less experienced riders – the result being a fantastic combination of steely determination and genuine ability.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Hudson, Area and Business Fundraiser for Naomi House, commented: &lt;em&gt;“There are fundraising challenges and then there are fundraising challenges. Serocor are really going all out on this one, and to cycle 300 miles over three days is no mean feat. We wish them all the very best with their challenge and thank them for their fabulous and inspiring support.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom continued, &lt;em&gt;“Whilst it's a great challenge it is nothing compared to the fantastic work that Naomi House &amp;amp; Jacksplace do every day. The hospices provide invaluable palliative care that includes respite, emergency and end of life care for children, young people and their families, affected by life-limiting and life-threatening circumstances. As a team and a business we are passionate about supporting charities however we can, so the City Cycle 300 challenge presented an interesting, challenging and fun way to try and make a difference.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The £20,000 fundraising target will make a huge difference to the charity and could fund the following&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 overnight respite stays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 week summer holiday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 hydrotherapy sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 music therapy sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Grandparents days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 weeks of nursing care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 youth club sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 family rooms for a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 week’s catering for family and visitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 additional hours of nursing care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riders have been training in their spare time, either in small groups or separately, whenever possible to prepare for the task – with two taking part in the 100 miles &lt;a href="http://ukcyclingevents.co.uk/events/wiggle-bournemouth-sportive/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wiggle Bournemouth Sportive event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Equally, the wider Serocor Group team will also be raising money in other ways, which include 'Turbo Days' – whereby riders cycle on two turbo trainers at the company's Havant HQ (the next of which is being held on Wednesday 3rd June, with support and awareness raising by representatives of Naomi House). The company is also holding a raffle and dress down day amongst staff on Friday 29th May – with prizes donated by suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>CC300 Day One Round Up 10th June 2015</title><description>With an early 7.20am start with perfect weather and road conditions, the team were pumped as they set off for their first 100 miles.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 cyclists taking on 300 miles over 3 days to raise £20,000 for Naomi House &amp;amp; Jacksplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;With an early 7.20am start with perfect weather and road conditions, the team were pumped as they set off for their first 100 miles. Today they cycled from our Headquarters in Langstone Technology Park in Havant finishing in Slough at 8.30pm. Completing today has been a tremendous achievement and we were so proud to see them approach the end of the first day, the mood was surprisingly energetic and upbeat after such a gruelling day!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some of the highlights from the team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Simon’s voicemails – he got separated from the group and had to be picked up by the support car – upon joining the group ‘Mike maybe don’t listen to those voicemail’s'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; No pictures!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The start line!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Finishing and reaching the hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The beautiful scenery we cycled through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Recovery vehicle bail out – Alan got separated from the group and was a 16 minutes’ drive/8 miles away from the main group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The tortoise group beating the hare group to the London office! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sand – now referred to as the ‘beach section’ of the ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Not being told not to wear boxers and cycling shorts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Stinging nettles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A3 – very scary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Oxford Street – Very busy! (in rush hour) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feelings about today:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Amazing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Good pace but a long day &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feelings about tomorrow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Bring it on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don’t know – won’t be there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Apprehensive, just looking forward to the hotel at the end of it! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Best Award&lt;/strong&gt; – Lauren MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Player Award&lt;/strong&gt; – Simon Lawton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;#CC300 Day Two Round-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Slightly earlier to bed tonight, we have just finished dinner. The team got in at 8.30 to the hotel, it's been a very long day in the saddle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team made good time this morning, the faster team, named Team Hare made it to the first stop point in good time. The second team named Team Tortoise made it to the stop a bit later due to Simon Lawton needing to be picked up by a support car as his chain broke. After a purchase of a new chain and Andrew MacDonald working his magic, the chain was fixed and the team back on their way. At this point Lauren decided to jump in the support car, she had felt very poorly that morning, maybe a spot of sun stroke or too many gels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams stormed ahead to the second stop on Abingdon, after being watered and fed with a slight cross over in timings the teams were headed for Kingsclere......well this is where things went wrong. Both teams got so very lost and their road bikes had to turn into mountain bikes. The support vehicle helped out and tried to put the teams back on route.....this is the point that things get a little blurry, the live track stopped and both teams were taking totally different routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway....we got the teams together in Upper Bucklebury at about 6 and picked up RBK as his knee was too sore to continue. The team rode on and arrived at the hotel at 8.30 one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been another eventful day of getting lost, off-roading, personal bests and going up mammoth hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Tortoise finishing at the same time as Team Hare (slow and steady following the sat nav seems to work best)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realising a road bike is not made for off road cycling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike peddling up White Hill - Alan described this hill as a wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBK deciding to give up for the day, this gave the others a peaceful ride after his departure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Andrew V throw all his toys out of the pram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Mike, Tom, Simon and RBK all fall off in the space of 100 metres&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being flagged down by a member of the public to be told that we are the most considerate cyclists he had ever met (Team Tortoise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOWLIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pesticide in the face whilst going past the power station near Abingdon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being dumped in the middle of nowhere by the support vehicle, as they couldn't help any further with directions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling 5 miles on the A34 next to Arctic lorries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being off road on our road bikes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waitrose running out of toilet roll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power station, it never seemed to go from view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting lost and making only 5 miles progress in 2 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT TODAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired, sore, bruised, pillow calling me, over tired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT TOMORROW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champions of the City Cycle 300 Challenge Jubilant Homecoming!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The brave cyclists, who took on the challenge to cycle a 300 mile route in 3 consecutive days to raise £20,000 for Naomi House and Jacksplace, reached their final destination of Serocor head office at 4.30pm on Friday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyclists started at Serocor head office in Havant and cycled a route that took in our two other southern offices (London and Bournemouth). They spent hours in the saddle and put in a punishing 100 miles a day with a support team of five. The final mileage racked up was 345 with 10,522 feet of elevation and 13,883 calories burnt. But with the final flapjack consumed, the last energy bar eaten, the last blob of chamois cream applied the epic journey had come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day three began early and team Hare arrived in Lyndhurst just before 9am. After a brief pit stop they set off for Bournemouth. Once again the pace was strong, despite the previous 240 miles and 25 hours from the previous two days and they managed to dodge the thundery showers that had been all over the forecast. They arrived in Bournemouth at 10:30am to a warm reception with an embroidered banner thanks to Anna-Marie and a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a slight mishap when one of the riders dropped his front wheel into a grate and promptly went over the handlebars, buckling the wheel significantly, the team made Southampton at a very steady pace having time in hand for their arrival in Havant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams lined up in convoy for the last stint on the journey into Havant. Friends, family and staff turned out to welcome the intrepid cyclists home and emotions were running high on all sides. What a fantastic voyage and full of moments both teams will cherish forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s over to the amazing team members to close the event with a few insights into the experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Channon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The total experience was nothing short of amazing and I feel a little lost without the prospect of such an event to look forward to. The Day 3 Ride was a real highlight, the camaraderie (great team spirit) made it for me, the support team were fantastic, and we couldn’t have done it without you. Finally the welcoming at Bloc &amp;amp; the Reception at LTP were nothing short of emotional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All in all, memories that will last a lifetime!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke Dunford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What an amazing few days. After seeing Naomi House before we went it really made me realise what a good cause we are helping. The pain we all went through over the 300+ miles really is worth it. Roll on next year?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;#CC300 Challenge – Tales from Team Hare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The highs, the lows and the sticky bits in between...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Unlike the famous hare from the Aesop fable ‘The Hare and the Tortoise’, no one on the hare team was caught napping! From day one the going was extremely tough and despite all the obstacles in their way they made it through to victory and an amazing homecoming courtesy of friends, family and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Hare Riders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alan “Marcel Kittle” Betteridge (Sales Director, ARM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew “Alberto Contador” McDonald (team mechanic / guest rider)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew “Jens Voight” Vaughan (Account Manager, ARM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin “Geraint Thomas” Chambers (Account Manager, ARM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark “Thor Hushovd” Channon (Bloc Director)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul “Dave Brailsford” Mallinson (Optamor Director)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team motto: “Shut up Legs”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epic journey began with an early start from the Havant HQ with perfect weather and road conditions. Both teams set off for the first 100 mile leg of the journey ending in Slough cycling together, but quickly split into two teams, Team Hare and Team Tortoise. With this part of the journey over and 12 hours in the saddle they were all filled with a sense of tremendous achievement and were tired but surprisingly upbeat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another early start on the second day, Team Hare made it to the first stop point in good time with both teams storming ahead to the second stop at Abingdon after a brief stint cycling along the A34! After setting off again for the last leg both teams got lost and found themselves off roading on their road bikes! Luckily the support team was on hand to help out and put the teams back on the right route. They all arrived at the hotel one after another to share stories of getting lost, off-roading, personal bests and riding up mammoth hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two gruelling days in the saddle Team Hare were all excited not only by the prospect of some proper riding on familiar roads, but also the inclusion of guest rider Andrew McDonald, team mechanic. With their route planned in their heads rather than via the Garmin Team Hare left Team Tortoise, setting off early to ensure they could reach the Bloc office in Bournemouth and be on course for the home stretch back to Havant. First stop was Lyndhurst, which the team reached before 9am then it was on to Bournemouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the pace was strong, despite the previous 240 miles and 25 hours from the previous two days. The hare team did well and managed to dodge the thundery showers that had been all over the forecast. They rocked up right on time and were welcomed with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and an embroidered banner from the Bloc office!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a minor mishap, which resulted in a buckled wheel the team made their way with a steady pace to Ocean Village, Southampton. After a quick check of emails and a final “band of brothers” moment of inspiration, the team headed for the penultimate stop and a liaison point with Team Tortoise also fondly know as Team Sat-Nav.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United with the Tortoise Pack the final leg of the journey into Havant began and it’s safe to say, the welcome reception was overwhelming for the whole team with emotions running high. After 345 miles, 10,522ft of elevation, 13,883 calories burnt, a serious amount of energy bars, flapjacks and copious amounts of chamois cream the journey was at an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the epic journey’s aftermath, how does the Hare Pack feel about the experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alan Betteridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I found the whole experience really exhilarating. From when we set a higher-than-necessary sponsorship target of £20,000, agreeing a very difficult physical challenge that no one in the group knew they were capable of completing, to then devising a plan to deliver these.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The partnership shown by the Serocor group staff, the riders and support teams was the catalyst in the success of this event. What resonates most with me is the enjoyment, and close bonds we all formed, particularly when at times we were physically and mentally drained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I want this to be the start of a wider cycling legacy that ARM becomes well known for. It is an excellent story to tell potential hires into our company and a good case study when clients ask what we are doing around 'corporate responsibility'”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I feel honoured to have been part of the support team that helped the cyclists through this amazing challenge – a very emotional experience!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Channon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The total experience was nothing short of amazing and I feel a little lost without the prospect of such an event to look forward to. The day three ride was a real highlight, the camaraderie (great team spirit) made it for me, the support team were fantastic, and we couldn’t have done it without you. Finally the welcoming at the Bloc office and the reception at Havant HQ were nothing short of emotional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;All in all, memories that will last a lifetime!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew MacDonald – Team Mechanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Two words spring to mind ‘emotional and proud’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have the utmost respect for everyone who took part and organised the whole event, you all have shown what can be done when you put your heart and soul into something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;As someone from outside the company I was honoured to be allowed to help over the three days and to take part on the final leg into Havant HQ, I kept in the background as the real stars were the other 11 riders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hollie, Kim, Andrew and Paul in the support team were great and looking back I had no low points just many high points along the way especially Lauren (my daughter) making it into London.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again thank you all for making my time with you so enjoyable and memorable”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Serocor Team Journey to London for the Global Recruiter Awards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The Serocor Group (encompassing ARM, Optamor, Bloc, Hawker Chase and Serocor Solutions) is delighted to reach the finals in two categories of Global Recruiter UK Industry Awards; winners will be announced at the awards ceremony this evening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People Development team has been shortlisted for Best in-house Training for its work in moving employees forward in their career and increasing their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment Consultant Adam Razzell has reached the finals of the Best Temporary Consultant category for his sales performance, customer service and taking a leading role in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Recruiter UK Industry Awards are judged by a team of experts drawn from the industry itself. These awards identify the best of the best from the current UK recruitment industry according to clear criteria. Each category sets out to record and reward the very best practice in the industry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes to the team and fingers crossed for some silverware!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;#CC300 Challenge - Tales from Team Tortoise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The highs, the lows and the sticky bits in between&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Like the tortoise in the Aesop fable ‘The Hare and the Tortoise’ the slow and steady pack rode and rode. They never, ever stopped until they came to the finish line. Despite phones being left in vans and shots being fired, the pack made it through to victory and an amazing homecoming courtesy of friends, family and staff. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Tortoise Riders: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Mike Gawthorne (CEO, Serocor Group)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Simon Lawton (Non Executive Director, Serocor Group)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Lauren MacDonald (Recruitment Consultant, ARM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Luke Dunford (Team Manager, ARM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Richard Burgess-Kelly (Senior Recruitment Consultant, ARM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Tom Hickling (Senior Recruitment Consultant, ARM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team set off bright and early on day one from our Havant HQ for the first 100 miles, with it quickly becoming apparent that there would be two teams based on speed, Team Hare and Team Tortoise. There were a few mishaps for the tortoises, including following Tom’s suggestion that the best route was via a quarry/sandpit, the battery on the Garmin running out and the foray into a firing range with live shots being fired. However, the gorgeous scenery and Tom’s fall into a thorny bush more than made up for the day’s misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day two, Team Tortoise made it to the stop a bit later than Team Hare as Simon needed to be picked up by a support car due to a broken chain. After the purchase of a new chain and the help of team mechanic Andrew McDonald, they were on their way once more. Both teams stormed ahead to the second stop at Abingdon and then headed on to Kingsclere, which is where a few issues began to arise. Both teams got seriously lost and had to use their road bikes as mountain bikes across paths more suited to tractors, where Mike, Tom, Simon and Richard all fell off their bikes in the space of 100 metres! However, the support vehicle was on hand to try and put the teams on the right track and to cheer the team up White Hill, which looked like a mountain it was so steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the team arrived back at the hotel around 8.30pm, just behind Team Hare who had also gotten very lost, closing a day of personal bests, off-roading, getting lost, enormous hills and being flagged down by a member of the public who commended the team on their considerate road manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day three and each team decided to take different routes due to the commitment of arriving back into the Havant HQ at 4.30pm. Team Hare set off with a strong pace headed for the Bournemouth office.  Team Tortoise headed off to the New Forest without the use of the GPS tools and maps, as Mike was confident he knew the way, until they were just outside Winchester and the roads apparently, decided to change. Once again off road, the team cycled down a bumpy bridleway, which was no problem for their now mountain road bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team made good time to the first stop at Balmer Lawn and then onto Beaulieu. After a ride around the New Forest, the team made for Ocean Village in Southampton, again making good time and arriving by 1pm. The teams united at Cams Mill, Fareham and by now it was time for a team beer and a sit down. Spirits were high and the team chatted about their experiences over the last three days and about how much they were going to enjoy a relaxing weekend without their bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 11 riders rode together as the final leg into Havant began, with the two support vans ahead and truthfully it was more than a little emotional. The team stopped just outside the Havant office for one last team talk and then rode on together to be greeted by a huge welcome reception with cheers, clapping and hugs from friends, family and colleagues. After 345 miles, 10,522ft of elevation, 13,883 calories burnt a serious amount of energy bars, flapjacks, bananas and copious amounts of chamois cream the epic journey had come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the epic journey’s aftermath, how does Team Tortoise feel about the experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Hickling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Having now had time to look back at this whole event and the outcome, I couldn’t be prouder of what we achieved as a business, but also as a team. Collectively this has been a huge effort, not only for the organisation, but also what we achieved in terms of money raised in 4 ½ months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work, time and effort that everyone put in was incredible but, we also know that the money raised will only go so far in terms of what Naomi House &amp;amp; Jacksplace actually require.  We look forward to helping them in the future and that any money raised will benefit the charity, but more importantly will help those children and their families enjoy the time they have together and bring some joy and smiles to those affected.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke Dunford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The last six months of training and preparation has really shown me what can be achieved if you put your mind to it. From not owning a bike to riding 300 miles in 3 days is a great personal achievement of mine. Especially as a week before the event I had convinced myself that I couldn’t do it! The teamwork from the riders, support teams and colleagues back in the office really show what a great company we work for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raising over £15k for such an amazing charity is something that we can all be very proud of and I am sure that Naomi House &amp;amp; Jacksplace will put the money to excellent use. Having had the opportunity to visit Naomi House and see first hand the work they do, I couldn’t think of a better charity to support”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Gawthorne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I found the whole experience very fulfilling.  The team did themselves, their families and the company proud and best of all we have raised a significant amount of money for a fantastic charity.  Roll on the next challenge but let’s make sure we don’t get as lost next time!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Lawton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A wonderful and challenging ride with some like-minded and adventurous people full of fun and laughter all for a great children’s cause.  Can we use some maps next time?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Mavericks can be Star Players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Be bowled over by Martin on Why Mavericks can be Star Players, part two of the Optamor Sporting Series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;I am sure we have all worked with people at some time in our careers that might be regarded as maverick. That person who is not seen as the greatest team player, doesn’t adhere strictly to the rules and has an annoying habit of rubbing more orthodox team members up the wrong way. I am not going to name names!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if these people are not up to the job then chances are they won’t last very long in their role. But, what if they are (or have the potential to be) your star performers, the people you can count on every quarter to hit the number, create the marketing strategy that gives the business the edge over your competitors, or engineer the next must have product? As Bruce Feirstein said: “The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the recent headlines surrounding the omission of batsman, Kevin Pietersen, from the England cricket team, as the ECB (English Cricket Board) makes its preparations for The Ashes that got me thinking about how every manager will be faced with a similar dilemma at some point. What do you do with a maverick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Kevin Pietersen, he is undoubtedly a world-class cricketer who would be the first name picked to play for most teams if going on pure talent, but the selectors at the ECB decided that his presence could potentially disrupt the team away from the field. This is not limited to one sport and similarly, as England Rugby team Head Coach, Stuart Lancaster has faced a similar issue recently with players such as Danny Cipriani, Manu Tuilagi and Dylan Hartley, as he selects his squad for the Rugby World Cup later this year. Ultimately, in sport as in business, you are judged on results, so time will tell if taking the ‘safe’ route pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, harmony on and off the pitch, in and out of the office or shop-floor, is a vital element to success, and sometimes a person and a position are just not meant to be, especially if their behaviour brings the name of the team or company into disrepute. But, if you are discounting the game-changers in exchange for a quiet life, then there is a good chance you are also limiting your organisations potential for success. After all, how would Wisden read if ECB selectors in the past had not chosen mavericks such as Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff, or Kevin Pieterson?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience of helping organisations to nurture and grow their talent alongside managing teams throughout my career (as well as playing a lot of cricket), it is so important to have an individual or two within a team that are prepared to challenge convention, think outside the box, or take the occasional risk (within reason of course!). It is also important that leaders see the importance of having individuals that challenge them and their team to rethink an approach or see things differently to be able to find the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, strong leadership is also about establishing the boundaries (and the penalties for crossing them). Knowing this will give your talent the freedom and support they need in their working life to express themselves, explore and achieve their potential and in doing so help your organisation reach its goals. Take the time to understand exactly what it is that motivates them and listen, challenge and debate their perspectives, and don’t be afraid to adapt and change – that is strong leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a huge cricket fan I will be avidly watching how England perform against Australia in the forthcoming Ashes series. However, I can’t help thinking that when the time comes, they might just miss that little magical touch and spark of genius, and the management may just wish that they had a maverick talent on their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be bowled over by Martin is brought to you in accordance with ‘seeing things differently’, the trade mark of Optamor Talent Partnerships! &lt;a href="http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/optamor-qi.aspx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the Optamor QI Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see things differently with us.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Serocor Group - Winners in their Own Words</title><description>As you may know, the Serocor Group (encompassing ARM, Optamor, Bloc, Hawker Chase and Serocor Solutions), won the Best In-House Training award at last week’s Global Recruiter UK Industry Awards.</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/serocor-group-winners-in-their-own-words/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1950.aspx</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1488/global-recruit-award-header-1-230x230.jpg" width="230" height="230" alt="global-recruit-award-header 1 230x230.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Global Mobility in a Modern Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global Mobility in a Modern Age debate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years numerous companies have experienced “significant growth in the international mobility of their workforce as employees move between markets to meet business objectives” as noted by the Oasis HR Think Tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recognised that employee populations are the most diverse they have ever been with regards to both personal circumstances and background. Organisations need to consider whether traditional working practices and assignments suit the needs of both their evolving employee base and those who will become employees of their business in the future. As the Oasis HR Think Tank rightly stated, “whilst traditional assignment approaches remain relevant, technology has evolved to a place where individuals can work on a more flexible basis and adopt a ‘virtual role’ working across geographies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you considered this within your own organisation? What impact will flexible and global working requests and practices have on your business, your management of both people and projects and the employee welfare of your teams? It is widely recognised that this approach can support the in country familial and commuting issues faced, but have you considered that this approach can also span countries and continents which could assist in the war on talent that we are currently experiencing in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach can have many positive benefits to your organisation, but it also has its challenges. So what are the business drivers? What do you need to think about and get right when considering this approach? Firstly above all else what is your objective? Why is having employee mobility and virtualisation important to your business? Have you scoped out what success looks like? Is it sustainable or is it a reaction to a business challenge you do not think you can currently overcome without taking this approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you considered global technology issues? Can your teams operate in an effective and joined up manner no matter where they are based? Can they access your servers, your data and each other in an efficient way? Will this minimise the impact of global travel and assignments and the costs associated with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Oasis HR Think Tank discussed, will operating in this way allow you to remain commercially competitive once you have taken into account the “costs, taxes and social security implications associated with these assignments? Each case needs to be defined to ensure the employee is having the right allowances that suit them but do not cost the business unnecessarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to consider what your organisation considers to be global mobility, how is it defined? What rules of engagement are there for flexible “commuter” working, business travellers and the more formal short or long term assignments? Are these definitions supported both operationally and strategically? Do you have appropriate HR and employee policies and do you have the correct allowances in place? Clear guidelines are essential for a smooth operational process which is clear to all users and links to the relevant internal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, employee welfare is also a key consideration for HR for any employee on assignment. Have you looked at the cultural awareness piece? Do you understand the rigours of international assignments and the impact on your teams? As providers of cultural awareness training to our clients, Optamor fully appreciate the operational and personal impact that this can have if it has not been considered and undertaken prior to travel. When team members are on short term assignments this support is often overlooked in favour of those longer term engagements. Some businesses will see this expenditure on short term assignments as an unnecessary additional cost, but what is the impact and cost if the assignment is not successful? It is fair to say that education and training is a key element of any successful mobility project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you measure the success of your global mobility project? What does good look like for your organisation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear objective and scope is essential. In conjunction with a simple, streamlined approach, an operational and HR structure that is able to provide clear policies, advice and guidance, management of risk and data analytics from both an employee and assignment perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Optamor sponsored Think Tank raises some interesting views on this subject. &lt;a href="http://oasishr.com/rmtt-global-mobility-in-a-modern-age-virtualisation-of-the-workforce/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the Executive Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New mums? We've got your bump and baby covered...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The Mums’ Network, an internal mechanism designed by Heather Cracknell Head of People Development to support pregnant women within the workplace, launched in February.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather has had first hand experience of being a working mum and she has seen on a professional level how women within the workplace are treated when starting a family.  The network was designed to bring together a support mechanism for mums-to-be, mums on maternity leave and mums that have returned to work after having their baby. It is also worth mentioning that in the last 18 months, 100% of mums have returned to work for the Serocor Group after having their babies, which is a brilliant accolade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mums’ network takes place bi-monthly enabling mums to share their experience of being pregnant at work, what it's like on maternity leave and how it feels returning to work. The opportunity to speak to other mums helps those anxious mums-to-be to discuss and ask for advice about being a mum in the working world and allay any returning to work fears.  We are lucky enough to have a second time mum who returned to work here recently, and who is a font of knowledge regarding all baby and working queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We foster an environment where anything and everything can be discussed, experiences shared and suggestions offered on how you can approach your daily life during the challenges of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our mums-to-be notes: “&lt;em&gt;From listening to other people's experiences I felt quite lucky that the company has made changes for the better to look after their mums-to-be. It’s good to have a small network of people who are experiencing the same things as you, or have already been through it, as well as being able to off load without being formal&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one says: “&lt;em&gt;It is nice to have a support group within work who you can speak to about any silly questions!” Another one of our ARM mums to be&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our mums returning to work after her first child says: “&lt;em&gt;I think it'll be a good source of encouragement and support to any expectant and new mums in the future. It'll also help the business to recognise areas for improvement and gives this group of employees the chance to input their ideas and thoughts through a recognised channel&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Director of Client Services at Optamor, Claire Proudlove, invites you to grab a quick cuppa while she ponders...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Hire: Define, Measure, Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the debate, share your views and hear the thoughts of other organisations on this subject in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Optamor-QI-3679707/about?report%2Esuccess=9SZDPq52zLke3l-b6QHPi-0zPEE35OpqJfeNIPmqmEzQdpL16J12lcmzQgdf3u5zHHUaVDXzmTqBAfLIHlggIWlIb4xX4CnIgdAazRNPW0eff5_ZkJTC3bgqm4qOzCpZHF12GLU1QdYblHbStJJ23DqzPjJff5oI6Ce2GU1--tgbZgQA6zIRpK"&gt;Optamor QI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;It is fair to say that with positive market growth and increased competition for candidates in multiple sectors of the recruitment market that the quality of hire debate has surfaced again to the top of internal recruitment and HR agendas. Organisations are striving to find a robust, efficient and cost effective strategy which result in excellent quality of hire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that process and data on quality of hire is paramount, but that at the end of the day filling roles and ensuring that you have found the right person for your organisation is more important to your internal hiring community than your internal ROI measurements. You should define, measure and report in order to improve your recruitment strategy and function not as a justification of the success of your recruitment team. Ensuring consistent quality of hire processes should be about “ensuring a cohesive and stable work force through today’s growth and beyond” as highlighted by Marcelle Foxcroft at the OasisHR Think Tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recruitment and HR teams, you must determine before gathering the data why its collection is important, what is the output you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you trying to measure organisational health or perhaps to influence your business to change its attitude to what quality of hire looks like in your organisation? Will you capture induction feedback, exit interview data, staff survey results and the physical output of your recruitment KPIs and ratios? What period of time will you measure? What data will you consider anomalies that have a detrimental effect on your information and ultimately your results? Who will you involve? Are you being realistic, are you going to use the outputs effectively to improve your organisation and the people who join it? Does one size fit all? These are all questions that you must ask yourself in your scoping period to ensure that you end up with useful data and not just another report that will sit unused and gather dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Marcelle Foxcroft says “there will be huge variations in appropriate data in project-led businesses/consultancies, sales vs. non-billing teams, and businesses with a high intake/turnover of graduates. For the latter it’s important not to lose focus on investing in measuring this population due to potential unreliability of data. After all, they are the mid-senior management of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your hiring community on-board will be critical to the success of your project. You will need to educate (and involve them where possible) on what an effective quality of hire strategy will mean for them and the positive effect that it will have on their business unit and team members. Through inexperience or a desire to recruit in their image many hiring managers are “still hiring in their own likeness” or “backfill a specific person when this may not address their team’s or the business’ actual needs.” In Optamor’s experience through delivering on-site interview training and emotional behaviour projects for our clients, we recognise the positive impact interview training can have on the future success of your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you track quality of hire you have an additional quantitative tool which may help you identify why a candidate may not be right for your organisation. It may also help you identify if the “millennial” candidates who are joining your business are having an effect on your data and whether portfolio careers are taken into consideration when you are both conducting exit interviews and analysing your data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does best practice look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be fair to say that a “gold standard has yet to be widely acknowledged”, but it is generally agreed that the following may help in building a framework: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Engaging with a third party supplier such as Optamor to produce a bespoke Talent &amp;amp; Training Report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• A partnership approach between Recruitment and Talent/L&amp;amp;D teams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Training and developing your hiring managers – from job specification creation to successful new hire on-boarding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Capturing a wide enough cross section of data points and time measurements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Focusing on new hire potential and supporting them with an appropriate development plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• An open and honest recruitment process for all users of the service &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you measure success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the end in mind. With many schemes taking at least 12 months for usable data to emerge it is important that you review the scheme parameters as well as the data it produces. Continuous improvement will ensure that your policy remains right for your business as it evolves and grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however it is what you do with the data that will matter. Will you try and emulate successes and ensure issues are dealt with or as I have said before will your data output be another business report that gathers dust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Staggering number of new mums forced out of work according to a new report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;A new report has been released by the Equality of Human Rights Commission to coincide with its #worksforme awareness initiative to reduce pregnancy and maternity discrimination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) commissioned a programme of research to investigate the prevalence and nature of pregnancy discrimination and disadvantage in the workplace. The results in the report are based on interviews with 3,034 employers and 3,254 mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report findings...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report found that over 54,000 new mothers are forced out of work every year, a shockingly high number. More than one in ten women said they were dismissed, made redundant or treated so badly that had no option but to give up their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we say...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather Cracknell of Serocor Solutions says: “From personal experience new or working mothers do have challenges in the work place, however within Serocor Group we are really focused on engaging new mums and ensuring our pregnant mums are engaged, treated with respect and encouraged to return to the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have introduced additional policies regarding flexible and variable working. We also introduced a forum called “New Mums Network” so that pregnant mums and those on maternity leave or those just returning to work have a support network available to them.  In the past 18 months we have had a 100% success rate of all our mums returning to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not take much to ensure that individuals are treated with respect and dignity and welcomed back into the workplace”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it all Plain Sailing with your Crew?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Navigate yourself to dry land with Martin on: ‘Plain sailing with your crew’, part three of the Optamor Sporting Series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;This month Portsmouth is home to the first races of the America’s Cup World Series, as teams strive to qualify for the 35th &lt;span style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;America’s Cup which takes place in Bermuda in 2017. From 23rd through to the of 26th July, all eyes will be on Sir Ben Ainslie and his Land Rover BAR team, which is also based in the City, as they begin their quest to be the first British team to win the Cup since its origin in 1851.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Optamor office close to the shores of the Solent, at this time of year I often look at the boats out on the water with a touch of envy, as I undertake my commute. Many of the yachts I see have been chartered by businesses and have crews consisting of lucky employees on teambuilding days. Whilst these crews may not be ready to take on the demands of the America’s Cup just yet, they will all be learning important skills on deck which will hopefully make them better prepared when they are back at their desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while I may love the idea of feeling the air flow through my hair, ok hairs, I know full well the meticulous planning of strategy and tactics required whether it is an around the world adventure, or a jaunt around the Isle of Wight.  Additionally, the crew need to be trained and everyone needs to recognise their role (and everyone else’s) and what is expected of them. It is vital that each member of the team make the necessary contribution, there is no room for passengers. This is a very familiar challenge to the many organisations that we support through the delivery of niche training and coaching interventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside training to realise the full potential of the crew, a yacht needs a strong and inspirational leader at the helm. The crew can have all the talent and training in the world, but it needs someone with the ability to direct and experience to know when to correct course. During the last America’s Cup in 2013, Oracle Team USA was being comprehensively beaten 8-1 in the series by Emirates New Zealand, however, the Oracle team took the bold move to bring in Sir Ben Ainslie as its ‘master’ tactician and they came from behind to win every remaining race and take the series. The same crew, the same yacht, but a very different performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A winning crew has trust in one another's capabilities, communicates well and has a skipper that pulls all of its talent together in unison. In doing so it becomes fast, agile and able to adapt to whatever the weather, sea state or competition throws at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting out on the water is a great way to put your team to the test (and have some fun along the way). The confines of a small deck will shine a light on how your team pulls together when under pressure and out of their comfort zone.  However, an annual day away from the workplace is no substitute for ongoing talent management, training, coaching and teambuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is yacht racing, selling, engineering, programming etc everyone wants to be the best they can be at what they do. So, when I join the tens of thousands of spectators in Portsmouth to watch the catamarans racing at speeds of up to 47 knots (a staggering 55 miles per hour!), it will be a powerful reminder of what outstanding feats can be achieved when we create a working environment that empowers people to work as a team and develop their talents to their fullest potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;#CC300 Challenge - The Last Tale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The CC300 epic journey finally came to an end on Monday 27th July with a visit to &lt;a href="https://www.naomihouse.org.uk/"&gt;Naomi House and Jacksplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;The team toured Jacksplace, which is currently providing respite care for both the children and young adults who attend both hospices. Naomi House hospice is currently undergoing a huge refurbishment, which will provide larger bedrooms for the children on overnight stays. The new look Naomi House will be unveiled on 12th September 2015 with an &lt;a href="https://www.naomihouse.org.uk/events/showevent/naomi-house-open-day"&gt;Open Day&lt;/a&gt; where everyone is welcome to attend and view the refurbishments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epic CC300 challenge took place over three days in June, 10th – 12th with eleven riders and five support staff from across the Serocor Group of companies, comprising:  ARM, Bloc, Optamor, Hawker Chase and Serocor Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team cycled 345 miles in three days stopping at our two southern offices and our office in London. The ride was no mean feat as the team spent over twelve hours in the saddle for the first two days due to spending a fair amount of the time taking the wrong route, which included riding their road bikes along bumpy bridleways and racing the famous red buses in London!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width: 455px; height: 339px; float: right;" src="/media/1151/serocor-naomi-house-arm-optamor.jpg?width=455&amp;amp;height=339" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presented Area Fundraiser, Sarah Hudson with the cheque for the final amount raised by the CC300 team, an astonishing &lt;strong&gt;£18,120.61&lt;/strong&gt; which will be used to help fund vital nursing care and respite stays, hydrotherapy and music therapy sessions. The team also presented Sarah with a framed CC300 team jersey signed by all 16 team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a gruelling three days in the saddle and many more hours spent training and fundraising, it was a fantastic experience for the team to be able to see how the money they raised will make a substantial difference to the children and young adults that the hospices care for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Channon, Bloc Director&lt;/strong&gt; had this to say about his own personal experience on the visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The visit to Naomi House and Jacksplace was an invaluable final piece to the chapter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To see the outstanding facility and meet the amazing staff brought everything home; it was an emotional experience and certainly I had mixed feelings. On one hand it was so rewarding to deliver the cheque and understand the benefit it brings to this wonderful establishment and the families it supports. But on the other hand, the reality of life for other families who are not as fortunate as I am to have a healthy child became clearer to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It left me with one simple feeling… I want to do more!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Chambers, Account Manager at ARM&lt;/strong&gt; had this to say about his experience on visiting Naomi House and Jacksplace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The tour gave me a real understanding of the huge undertaking by Naomi House and Jacksplace and showed what a fantastic charity it is, and how much it impacts not just the children it cares for, but their whole families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whilst the facilities are first class, what tangibly appears to make the most impact, is the carers themselves and how much they involve and immerse themselves in a truly wonderful charity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; I’m extremely glad the Serocor Group was able to contribute and the visit certainly helped to put things in perspective especially when things got tough on the ride!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Gawthorne, Serocor Director&lt;/strong&gt; commented on his experience of visiting Naomi House:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To hand over a cheque for more than £18,000 to such a fantastic cause was amazing, the staff and facilities at Naomi House and Jacksplace are truly outstanding, and for us to be able to offer an element of support to this charity (although monetary) is very fulfilling. I am truly inspired to continue to support such a worthwhile cause; I just wish we could do more!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Serocor Group would like to take the time to thank the companies that have supported and sponsored us along the way; we couldn’t have done it without your kind donations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Quick Cuppa with Claire on Diversity: Overcoming the Obstacles of Attracting and Recruiting Women into Male Dominated Industries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Join the debate, share your views and hear the thoughts of other organisations on this subject in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grps/Optamor-QI-3679707/about?report%2Esuccess=9SZDPq52zLke3l-b6QHPi-0zPEE35OpqJfeNIPmqmEzQdpL16J12lcmzQgdf3u5zHHUaVDXzmTqBAfLIHlggIWlIb4xX4CnIgdAazRNPW0eff5_ZkJTC3bgqm4qOzCpZHF12GLU1QdYblHbStJJ23DqzPjJff5oI6Ce2GU1--tgbZgQA6zIRpK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optamor QI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead" style="line-height: 1.43;"&gt;As stated by Anthony Lasocki (Head of Talent Acquisition, EMEA) at Verizon companies who operate within a typically male-dominated industry often recognise the importance of attracting more women into their businesses. However, although some industries have moved beyond establishing a business case for balancing the number of men and women in their organisation and with practical diversity policies being in place it is fair to say that with the multiple hiring pressures that exist in skill scarce markets these initiatives can often take a back seat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure gender diversity remains a key HR agenda item it would be prudent to identify and understand what best practice options can support it. It is crucial however to consider that for any diversity initiative to succeed your business and its internal culture needs to be able to support diverse talent. By “seeing things differently” we should start with those policies that can positively influence gender diversity in your organisation and not just focus on the obstacles that have created it. Your overall talent approach will have a significant impact. So what areas should you consider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talent Acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employer branding and messaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to develop a gender diverse workforce, but it is imperative to organisational success that ultimately you hire the right person. Talent of any description should not be made to feel that they are being used to hit a policy scorecard or that they are part of a short term initiative to bring people in. When looking to attract women to your business employer messaging can bring your organisation to life. Consider who in your organisation could be inspirational to other women and ensure that any family friendly policies and benefits that currently benefit both your female and male workforce are appropriately promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your talent acquisition channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where social media is prevalent and highly useful in the talent attraction process when looking to hire a more diverse range of employees, make sure you’re thinking about the types of places in the social media space where they spend their time. Ensuring you find a way to reach out to them which promotes your business as a place they want to be. Reaching out in this way should also be considered within the educational system. If you operate in an industry where the challenge of hiring into STEM positions is already impacting your business you will know that the need to engage with employees of the future whilst they are still deciding on where their future may lay is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally if you acquire talent through talent providers and recruitment agencies it is essential that they understand and know how to promote your diversity objectives. Your employer branding and messaging is imperative to them in finding you the right talent for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you offer or have you considered flexible working? When your policies are clear and they apply to many it is a great way to help attract top talent to your business as long as you remember to tell people in your talent attraction policies that it is on offer. Anthony Lasocki has pointed out that although it is becoming more prevalent in organisations “only 6.2% of organisations will actually state that it’s on offer in their job adverts! This could be a great way of attracting more diverse applicants by being more upfront about what’s on offer.” It is important to remember that flexible working can take a number of different formats and what works for one organisation may not work for another. The key is to find a policy that works for your business and allow it to support you in attracting a diverse workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talent Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop your people and ensure you have an inclusive culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experience Optamor recognises that some organisations will need support in understanding what impact their hiring community and teams are having on the success of their diversity policy. You may need to train and educate key people in your organisation to recognise the impact that they are having when making both hiring decisions and considering succession plans. Supporting these talent acquisition behaviours with the development of an inclusive culture helps breed and promote the right behaviours and creates a good working environment for women both to be employed by and return to after having a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review where your diverse hires come from and invest in those channels if appropriate to increase your numbers further&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train your hiring managers and employees on the importance of diversity, but do not lose focus on finding the right person for the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer training to individuals to allow them to up-skill or re-train into areas of the business where diversity would be advantageous to both them and the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to existing and future talent through social platforms and the educational system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not treat diversity like a project&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New mums? We've got your bump and baby covered...On the best time to break the good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Heather Cracknell, Head of People Development implemented the Mums’ Network including a number of policies and procedures to ensure mums to be and new mums are supported in the best way possible both before and after the birth of their child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth blog in the series where we feature new mums returning to work and mums to be going off on maternity leave (and everything in between). We ask them to comment on the provisions currently in place for new mums and whether or not these could be improved. Our third interview is with Deb who works for Optamor and is due to go on maternity leave for the third time any day now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you feel about telling the business you were pregnant?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a nerve-wracking time to tell your employer that you are expecting a baby, because it inevitably means a degree of upheaval and change. And&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;it’s not only for you as a person, but also for the business and your team and that’s something that you’re always conscious of. This was my third pregnancy announcement in almost as many years and so I was naturally full of trepidations as I wasn’t sure what the response would be! However, the support that I have received from the point of announcing my pregnancy has been great. I haven’t felt criticised or unworthy, which is something I have worried about in the past. My manager and team have worked together over the past few months to ensure a smooth transition out of the business, whilst keeping one eye on what will happen again on my return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you let them know early on in your pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did let my manager and HR know after around three months with each pregnancy but with hindsight I wish I had informed them before. It can be really tricky to gauge when to let your employer know, because there’s a fine line between sharing the news before you’re really ready to - or even before you’ve told your family and friends - but if you are struggling with the less glamorous sides of early stage pregnancy like morning sickness, tiredness etc. it’s best to let HR and/or your Line Manager know (in confidence) so that they understand your sometimes erratic behaviour! Also if, in the sad circumstance that things don’t go according to plan, you’ve made your employer aware and they are more likely to be prepared to offer you appropriate support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How supportive were they in the early part of your pregnancy (during morning sickness etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first thing that happens when you announce your pregnancy is that HR conduct a health and safety review to ensure that any immediate needs are met. This is then re-visited throughout the pregnancy to ensure your safety and comfort. Best practice is then outlined to you so that you know who to turn to for support, and you are informed of your rights with regards to antenatal appointments etc. It’s a comfort to know that the support is there, and reassuring to know that your pregnancy is being taken seriously. Again, I think the important thing is to make sure that the business is aware of your pregnancy so that they can take the necessary steps to provide the right support. If they don’t know, they can’t help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your reactions and thoughts to their response?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t really have to think too much more about it, from a work perspective it’s been business as usual. My colleagues have been supportive when I’ve needed it, but not treated me any differently or made a fuss, which suits me really well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the company support you returning to work in your previous pregnancies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I’m really honest my first experience wasn’t as I had hoped. There was no real communication from the business during my maternity leave, I wasn’t paid for Keeping in Touch days, I had to really push my way back in and it was a pretty uncomfortable experience coming back to work. But….I’m so glad I persevered and when I returned to work after my second baby it was a completely different experience, like working for a different company. I was communicated with much better during my time out of the business and I had a good welcome back. I even had a desk and a computer – which was an improvement from the previous return! Let’s hope that my third return will be even better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any other thoughts or views you want to add about the policies and processes in place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot of time and effort has been invested in improving the policies and processes, and it’s made it such a positive experience to be an expectant mother, and a parent returning to work. The option to request flexible working, the New Mum’s Network and the support from HR all go such a long way to making Optamor a supportive and inclusive employer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heather Cracknell, Head of People Development for Serocor Solutions picks up on Deb’s point regarding her previous experiences:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am so pleased that Deb’s experience for her second and upcoming third baby have been massively different from her first. It is so important for the business to ensure that pregnant mums are supported from the moment they inform us.  Having discussed the “when to tell” issue with all the new mums recently in the New Mums’ Network meetings, the general view is to inform your manager and HR in confidence as soon as possible.  Those early days of knowing you're pregnant while sometimes feeling dreadful and being unsupported can be a lonely and challenging place to be.  If we are informed we are then aware if there are days when someone is feeling under par and can support them through the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;In the fifth 'Women in business' series of blog posts, which highlight and support how important diversity in our workplace is, we talk to Training Manager at Optamor, Tara Davies as she offers us her sometimes controversial but always unique opinions on what it means to be a woman in business today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get where you are today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working hard, listening to feedback from colleagues/managers in roles that I’ve had and reflect and review on my performance. I’ve never been afraid to try something new given the opportunity. I have always kept my options open and taken on new challenges when they have come up or excited me.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which woman/women are inspirational to you and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds clichéd, but it’s my mum. She has worked hard all her life, sometimes doing a day and evening job while bringing two children up by herself. She gives 100% to everything she does and is well organised. She is fiercely loyal and very honest and will give you an opinion if you ask for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Thatcher – I know many people will think REALLY! But I think she was an inspirational woman. She was not frightened to let people know what she thought and she would not be bullied into changing her opinion even if it made her unpopular in government.  She made world leaders take Great Britain seriously and a force to be reckoned with. She worked in a male dominated world and challenged it in a tough era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What top 3 tips do you have for women in business today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Be yourself and confident in your abilities, don’t try to fit a mould. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and challenge constructively what you are being told&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Continue to develop yourself and reflect on your progress &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest changes you've seen in terms of women in business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More women are getting top jobs and also seem to have more opportunity to work in what was previously perceived to be a very male dominated sector (Engineering etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your dream job as a child and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a school teacher or an actress, I’ll let you make your own minds up about why!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Claire Proudlove, on who she is today</title><description>In the sixth 'Women in business' series of blog posts which highlight and support how important diversity in our workplace is, we talk to Director of Client Services at Optamor, Claire Proudlove as…</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/claire-proudlove-on-who-she-is-today/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1974.aspx</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1478/women-in-business-series-230x230.jpg" width="230" height="230" alt="Women in Business series 230x230.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Claire Proudlove, on who she is today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;In the sixth 'Women in business' series of blog posts which highlight and support how important diversity in our workplace is, we talk to Director of Client Services at Optamor, Claire Proudlove as she discusses her unique take on what it is to be a woman in business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get where you are today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work and accepting the need to develop my skills and approach to bridge the gap between parts of my inherent personality and the wider range of skills required to achieve success in my chosen field. I have a strong internal work ethic and can be openly stubborn when I truly believe in something. I don’t give up. For me, every day is a school day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What woman inspires you and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mum is a huge inspiration and taught me you can be yourself to achieve things. She juggled all aspects of her life and was a strong guiding light. There isn’t any one woman outside of my family that inspires me, rather I am inspired by types of people. I take inspiration from various balanced and mature people and I believe it’s about what they’ve achieved not who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What top 3 tips do you have for women in business today? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Don’t rely on being a woman. If you’re good enough, gender doesn’t matter. Go after what you want, be successful as a person not just as a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Work hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Be aware of your impact – seek support and advice where you need it. Learn about areas you need to develop. It is not a failure to surround yourself with good people. Be as generous with your knowledge as you expect others to be with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest changes you've seen in terms of women in business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally in the 18 years I have been working full time there has been a definite change. In terms of attitude/effectiveness there are more support structures to help women have a voice. We should be advocating the right people for the job and training the right people; for me it is not about fulfilling a quota. There is a need for new flexible structures in place in order to get people back to work and we are definitely seeing that now. Businesses need to recognise the importance of the retention of women; Serocor Group is the best example in my work history of the types of encouragement initiatives to keep women in the business. Ultimately however, ability should rise above any other trait.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your dream job as a child and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a journalist as I love words! I love to read, learn and understand things. When I had my tonsils out as a child I brought a dictionary with me to read! For those that know me well that will not be a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Are you winning the war on talent?</title><description>Serocor has teamed up with accounting and business advisory firm BDO and legal professionals Paris Smith to host a breakfast event to inspire and inform chief executives and other board directors in…</description><link>http://www.optamor.com/optamor-qi/blogs/optamor-news/are-you-winning-the-war-on-talent/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.optamor.com/1976.aspx</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.optamor.com/media/1477/are-you-winning-the-war-on-talent-230x230.jpg" width="230" height="230" alt="Are you winning the war on talent 230x230.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you winning the war on talent? Serocor, BDO and Paris Smith host talent seminar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;Serocor has teamed up with accounting and business advisory firm BDO and legal professionals Paris Smith to host a breakfast event to inspire and inform chief executives and other board directors in dealing with the issues of attracting and keeping a talented workforce. It will take place at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton on Tuesday 3rd November at 7.45am. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar will encourage employers to think differently about talent management through keynote speeches by industry professionals Tom Hadley, Director of Policy and Professional Services a the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, and ‘Google Dave’, Partner and Director of Client Services at PH. Creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers will also join Paul Mallinson, Managing Director of Optamor Talent Partnerships, and Judy Holliday, Head of Development at Arqiva, to lead a panel session on building talent for growth and tackling challenges head on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arm.co.uk/PDF/BDO%20Event%202015%20Brochure%20low%20res.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ THE FULL PROGRAMME HERE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will have the opportunity to influence the discussion topics by completing a short questionnaire in advance of the event. They will also receive a one page comparison report that will summarise their performance on ten aspects of talent management and enable them to benchmark against other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Thixton, lead partner at BDO Southampton says: “As part of BDO’s focus on the Central South Mid Market over the last 18 months we have spoken to a wide range of companies and they all have a common challenge when looking to grow their business – the ability to recruit and retain a talented workforce in a fiercely competitive labour market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Gawthorne at Serocor Group continues: “Businesses are facing profound challenges in attracting and keeping the right talent for growth, confidence is back and revenues are up however talent now appears to be on every board’s agenda as the main blocker to growth. This is driven by many factors, from new technology to changing demographics, combined with the global skills shortage during a time of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Taylor, Managing Partner at Paris Smith adds: "The fact of the matter is that employees have more options and employers have fewer; businesses need to review their strategies in order to tackle the challenge head on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serocor comprises a group of award winning talent management and recruitment companies encompassing ARM, Bloc, Hawker Chase, Optamor and Serocor Solutions. Established in 1996 and headquartered in Hampshire with four offices across the UK, the Group is considered a leading authority in the talent management space, providing talent solutions to some of the largest employers across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How you can win the war for talent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;There is a battle for talent that is raging in the UK recruitment market right now. With the correct strategy and tactics it is one that you can win, but in the words of Dave Hazlehurst of PH-Creative: “You won’t win the war for talent if you just do the normal stuff. You need to be brave.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rallying cry was given at the ‘Are you winning the war on talent?’ seminar, hosted by the recruitment and human capital management solutions company, Serocor, the accounting and business advisory firm BDO, and legal professionals, Paris Smith. The event took place at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton on Tuesday 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Recruitment &amp;amp; Employment Confederation (REC), placements have increased for 36 consecutive months and with 94% of employers saying they have little or no capacity to meet a rise in demand for their products/services, it is no surprise that 80% are planning to increase staff in the next three months. However, one of the biggest challenges is finding the right talent and making your organisation an enticing proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get creative and be brave&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy Holliday is the Head of Development at the communications infrastructure and media services company, Arqiva, and she advises that recruiters need to think more laterally and creatively. She explains that there can be a tendency to look for a replica of what went before, when trying to fill a vacancy. “Trying to find someone who has spent five years doing a particular job in a particular place, is so constraining.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on skills above all else is something that Paul Mallinson, the Managing Director of Optamor, a company specialising in talent management, thinks needs to be addressed. “What a lot of organisations fail to do is assess whether an individual will fit culturally within the organisation.” He explains that just because someone has delivered using a specific skillset at one organisation, it doesn’t mean they will be able to achieve the same level of performance for your business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mallinson’s advice is to try and attract the right talent then take time to assess if they are the right fit. “Don’t just base the decision on the job description. Accept that you may not be able to make the perfect hire, consider recruiting people that may have say three out of the five key skills attributes you require, but demonstrate all of the right behavioural characteristics, values, beliefs and willingness to learn.” He adds: “If you do this and then link recruitment with learning and development, you will arm them with the exact skills they need to perform for you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO of Serocor, Mike Gawthorne suggests taking a bold step and removing the CV from the process can have a positive impact on recruiting the right talent: “Line Managers can make too many assumptions based on the CV, so by the time a candidate arrives for interview they already have preconceptions about that individual. We have taken this step ourselves and some of our future top achievers have come through this process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting the right talent today and tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need to have a strategic long-term approach in terms of marketing, but there are clever tactical things you can do, if you are prepared to try new things,” explains &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+DaveHazlehurst/?rel=author"&gt;Dave Hazlehurst&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise known as ‘Google Dave’). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives a recent example of an organisation that had an immediate requirement for 120 developers and used Facebook Dark Posts (for every £1.50 spent they received a CV, the same process using Google would cost £37 per application). “You need to understand where your prospective talent hangs out online, what makes them tick and what you are going to say to them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazlehurst stresses that the recruitment industry is not about placing people in jobs, but about creating life changing moments for the individual and their family, and this needs to be acknowledged and reflected in how organisations market to, engage with and inspire their prospective talent pool. He strongly urges recruiters to seek out ways to engage emotionally with their talent pool, quoting Simon Sinek, who in his now famous TED Talk says: “People buy why you do it, not what you do.” Hazlehurst compares Apple and Dell, both successful companies but one leads with why the other with what. Today, Apple’s market cap is approaching $700 million and legions of brand evangelists around the world. “Think about why you do what you do and lead with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is supported by an REC survey which asked people to list their most important life decisions. 77% of respondents put finding the right job at the top, ahead of getting married, deciding where to live and starting a family.  “We need to put people at the very heart of the process,” adds Mallinson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the talent you already have and what you can do with it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As well as attracting new talent take a close look at what you already have,” suggests Holliday.  She makes the point that there is often an assumption that people will want to join and stay with an organisation. Hadley warns employers to be aware of the changing attitudes to work: “There is still a perception that everyone wants a permanent full-time job.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a clear understanding about what current and prospective employees want, their motivators and attitudes can have a big impact on where an organisation chooses to invest in its development. “Do you invest significantly in your millennials when actually you may only have them for two or three years? What about the ‘older’ talent that wants to stay? What opportunity and career paths do you provide for them?” asks Holliday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to find the right balance. The Director of Policy and Professional Services at REC, Tom Hadley points out that organisations need to be mindful of the demographic of their organisation, citing the experience of a large utility company that was shocked to discover as much as 20% of their workforce would be retiring within the next few years. “You need to think about the pipeline in order to compensate for people leaving the workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazlehurst agrees: “If you are only thinking tactically it is too late! As this war gets harder you have got to start thinking smarter and more long-term.” He adds: “You need to be ‘owning’ your community and engaging with it, becoming their best friends. Helping them for today, tomorrow and the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with specialists in recruitment&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending more time, effort and resource to attract and retain talent is clearly a message that is being understood.  “The recruitment industry is growing because there is a realisation that it isn’t all about cutting the costs of recruitment,” states Hadley. He points to the specific need to educate medium-sized businesses who are fighting the larger companies with deeper pockets for marketing to new talent. However, he is positive about the future, explaining that the Federation of Small Businesses has signed up to REC’s Good Recruitment Campaign. “I think there is going to be a big debate in the next few years around how we help smaller businesses grow by recruiting the right staff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth in the number of people choosing not to take a full-time permanent position (one in three people having worked as a contactor at some point during their career, and 41% currently considering it) could work in the favour of smaller organisations. It would enable them to bring in the skillsets they need as and when they need them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially organisations need to form alliances with those who have the armoury to help them to build their brands, attract and retain the right people, implement learning and development programmes, ultimately winning the war for talent and in doing so, gaining the competitive edge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Serocor Group are winners at Naomi House Corporate Awards 2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead"&gt;On 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November, Ria Kerridge and Heather Cracknell from the Serocor Group attended the Naomi House Corporate Awards 2015 at Winchester Science Centre where we were shortlisted for 3 awards; Physical Challenge of the Year, Directors’ Challenge of the Year, and New Corporate Supporter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that we won the award for New Corporate Supporter at last night’s event.  We caught up with Heather Cracknell, Head of People Development at Serocor Solutions, who says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;This is a great honour for us to win the award for New Corporate Sponsor, each year the Serocor Group choose a charity and this year the employees chose Naomi House and Jacksplace.  We as a company planned and participated in a number of different activities, including a monthly dress down day where all employees pay for the privilege of dressing in casual clothes. Two of our employees committed to doing the Clarendon Way Walk for Naomi House and another employee took part in Foam Fest and the biggest challenge we set ourselves was to embark on a 300 mile cycle ride to be completed over three consecutive days with every penny going to Naomi House and Jacksplace, plus many other fundraising ideas. For the company it has been hard work but good fun and has enabled different parts of the business to work as a team.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months, the Serocor Group has introduced a formalised volunteering scheme called Embrace.  This initiative encourages our employees to work with local charities and each employee is given 16 hours per year to volunteer.  Every year, the Serocor Group have a chosen charity which is voted for by its employees and this year it was Naomi House and Jacksplace.  We set ourselves a target of £20,000 to raise for the charity, the highest target we have ever committed to, and we are on course to beat this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also thrilled to say that we were runners-up in the ‘Physical Challenge of the Year’ and ‘Directors’ Challenge of the Year’ categories.  In June, our team of 11 challengers embarked on a 300 mile cycle ride over 3 consecutive days, setting off from our Havant base and taking in our 2 other southern offices.  It was a gruelling challenge, spending approximately 7-8 hours per day in the saddle, but the riders returned to a heroes’ welcome of friends, family and even the local Mayor and MP turned out to show their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the City Cycle challengers, Andrew Vaughan, says, ‘&lt;em&gt;Firstly, we would like to extend a big thank you to Naomi House and Jacksplace for this nomination, as a Group we feel extremely proud to have been considered for such a fantastic award.  Congratulations to the winners, who deserve particular recognition for their wonderful achievement and the amount of money they raised during their challenge.  The opportunity to raise money for Naomi House and Jacksplace was something that everyone within the Group was extremely passionate about, especially when you see what a real difference it can make to the special individuals who benefit from their love and care.  Although the challenge was extremely hard and at times demoralising, our sense of togetherness and team spirit never faltered as we realised why we were taking part.  Thank you once again for our nomination, it has been a great honour to have represented Naomi House and Jacksplace in 2015.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Channon, Director of Bloc, was pleased to have been nominated for Directors’ Challenge of the Year alongside Mike Gawthorne (CEO of the Serocor Group) and Paul Mallinson (MD of Optamor), &lt;em&gt;‘It was an honour to take part in this event and be nominated for this award, as with anything there is always an element of disappointment not to win, but in the grand scheme of things I am just proud to have been able to contribute to such a worthy cause.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Serocor Group have raised £19,200 to date for &lt;a href="http://www.naomihouse.org.uk/" title="Naomi House and Jacksplace"&gt;Naomi House and Jacksplace &lt;/a&gt;and we will continue to support them until the end of February 2016 with various fundraisers, aiming to beat our original predicted target of £20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
